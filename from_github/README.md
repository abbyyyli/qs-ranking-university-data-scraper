![](https://github.com/MostaqueBillah/qs-ranking-university-2024-data-scraper/blob/main/assets/qswebsite.png)

Hello good people!
This project aims to scrape a dynamic website. A snipet of the website is given in the beginninng. For an elaborative view you can visit the website [here](https://www.topuniversities.com/world-university-rankings/2024)
After scraping data, the aim is to use tableau public to look for insights within the data. You can also create cool tableau public dashboards for free. Just poen an account [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover2024), connect your data source and play with dashboards. If you are proud of your dashboard then you can publish it in Tableau Public online as well. In that case just download 'qs_university_ranking_file.csv' from this repo and play with Tableau. You could send me a link of your public dashboard via email (syed.mostaque.billah@gmail.com), and it will make me really happy.

**It is done for educational perpose only**

End results that you can produce if you follow this project!!!

# Motive

1. Scrape and collect data of University Ranking from this [link](https://www.topuniversities.com/world-university-rankings/2024).
2. Transform the data into csv file.
3. Visulize the dataset using Tableau.
4. Find a story using the dashboad.

# Data collection

**_Data consist of every university rank, name , location, points from 2018 to 2022. Not only that, inside of each university, their latest information is also collected._**

You can run this code and collect datasets. Thus you can build your own tableau Dashboard. To do this you have to follow these instructions.

1. Download [Google Chrome Driver](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) from based on your device:  
   unzip the downloaded file and collect the path where The Driver is saved.

2. Install Python on your device from [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3. Download this [Folder](https://github.com/MostaqueBillah/qs-ranking-university-2024-data-scraper) file, unzip the downloaded file, And Rename the file name.

4. (Optional) Create an environment for this project inside of the unzipped file. Click right button of mouse and select **Open in Terminal** and write these code one by one

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

```
pip install virtualenv
or
pip3 install virtualenv
```

```
virtualenv env
```

```
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

5. Then in the terminal write

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
or
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

6. After Completing install packages, write

```
cd scripts
```

Hit Enter

7. Then Write

```
python scraper.py
```

8. Hit Enter and Wait for 3 hours, Please Do not Touch Anything.

9. **(Optional)** After the first script you might run another script that will generate anothoer csv file.

```
python modify_csv.py
```

10. This will create another file which will include additional ranking based on every parameters. However in this project it will **not be necessary!**

**_After Completing all of works You'll get an Outputs in csv Format_**

## Impact of different Parameters in QS University Ranking:

Visit this [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/syed.mohammed.mostaque.billah/viz/ImpactofdifferentParametersinQSUniversityRanking/ImpactofdifferentParametersinQSUniversityRanking) for interactable dashboard.

### Story or Findings:

    The picture dashboard contains:
        1. Rank vs Citation Per Faculty: No strong co-relation found. But least ranked universities tend to have less citaion per faculty ratio.
        2. Rank vs Academic Reputaion: Rank and Academic reputaions show very strong co-relation.
        We can consider Academic Reputaion to be a big factor to achieve good ranking and vise versa.
        3. Rank vs Employer Reputaions & Rank vs Employee Outcomes: Strong corelation found.
        Top rank universities have way greater employee reputaion and employee outcomes.
        4. Rank vs International Faculty Ratio &
           Rank vs International Student Ratio &
           Rank vs Reasearch Network: No strong co-relation found.
        5.Rank vs Faculty Student Ratio:  No strong co-relation found.

## Interesting Corelations between Parameters in QS Top University Ranking

Visit this [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/syed.mohammed.mostaque.billah/viz/InterestingCorelationsbetweenParametersinQSTopUniversityRanking/Corelations) for interactable dashboard.

### Story or Findings:

    The picture dashboard contains:
        1. Employer Reputaions vs Employee Outcomes: Though a weak one but still a corelation persists.
        2. Academic Reputaion vs Citation Per Faculty: No clear pattern, but the density suggests
        low citation per faculty in some cases may indacate low academic reputaioned university.
        3. Overall Score vs Academic Reputaion: Strong and clear corelation. Better the reputation, better the rank!
        4. Academic Reputaion vs Employer Reputaions & Academic Reputaion vs Employee Outcomes: The density of scatter
        plot suggests a corelation. Acdemic reputaion does impact employeebility criterias for most of the time!
        5. Faculty Student Ratio vs Citation Per Faculty: No such corelation found.
        6. International Faculty Ratio vs Reasearch Network: No such corelation found.

# Challenges:

    1. The website has a few popups. But every popup appear within the first 2 minutes.
    2. You cannot read all data just after loading the website. In case of every university,
    you need to click at some internal tabs to reveal more data. and only then the scraper can read it.
    3. Setting addequate sleep time, to give the website enough time to load might become challenging.
    4. The overall project is a little time cnosuming to say the least.
    5. Tableau dashboards has a lot of options in terms of filter and conditions. It might get tricky
    for beginners.
